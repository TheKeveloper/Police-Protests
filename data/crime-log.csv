Officers approached  Cambridge Police and reported that CPD had been responding to a possible assault in progress, when the individual was      observed attempting to flee the immediate area and subsequently detained. While on scene, officers were then approached by three juveniles who wished to report a recent assault committed by the individual. According to the three juveniles, the individual had been observed accosting pedestrians while waving a wooden stake in the air inside of Harvard Yard. When the
three juveniles approached the individual regarding their behavior, the individual grabbed one of the juveniles by their  
head and a physical altercation ensued between all parties. According to the three juveniles, during the altercation, the 
individual repeatedly attempted to strike them with the aforementioned wooden stake. One of the juveniles then attempted  
to contact the police when the individual brandished a folded knife, waved it in the air, and stated ""I got a knife"".

Officers     arrived and reported that Cambridge Police was on scene and speaking with an individual matching the description of the    person engaged in the harassing and disruptive behavior. Officers then approached Cambridge Police who reported that a     victim was in the immediate area seeking medical attention due to an assault committed by the aforementioned individual.   While at the scene, officers reported that the individual began to engage in increasingly erratic behavior and was         subsequently placed in handcuffs by Cambridge Police. Cambridge Police then reported that a witness to the incident        previously observed the individual in custody throw a glass bottle at the victim's backpack which subsequently broke apart upon impact with the ground.

The individual was then informed that they were being      placed under arrest and transported to the Harvard University Police Department for booking.
